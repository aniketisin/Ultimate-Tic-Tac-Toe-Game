Rules:

Rule 1:
If the opponent places his cross/circle in one of the non-corner cells (which are 5 in number (if all open)) of any block, then you have to place your circle/cross in the block determined by the position of the opponent’s move.

Rule 2: If the opponent places a circle/cross in one of the 4 corner cells in any block, then you are allowed to choose open cells from 3 blocks (rather than 1) to make your move.

If there is no place in the destined block: If the block (or set of blocks) determined by the opponent for you to make a move has no empty cell, then you can choose to place your cross/circle at any of the open cells (in any of the blocks).

If the destined block is already won but has empty space (Abandon rule): Once a block is won, you CANNOT make a move in that block. (it will be a free move only in cases where the previous move wasn’t a corner cell move).

Winning the Game: The player who wins any of the 3 boards which are either in a row, a column or along the diagonal wins the game.
